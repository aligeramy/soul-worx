## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow

1. **Browse Community** → User visits `/programs/community`
2. **View Tiers** → Sees 3 membership options
3. **Sign In/Up** → Creates account via Discord/Google/Apple
4. **Subscribe** → Clicks "Get Started" on Premium/VIP
5. **Stripe Checkout** → Completes payment
6. **Webhook** → Stripe notifies your app
7. **Discord Role** → Bot assigns role automatically
8. **Access Content** → User can now watch unlocked videos

### Admin Flow

1. **Create Channel** → Admin creates "Basketball Skills"
2. **Set Tier** → Requires Tier 2 (Premium)
3. **Add Videos** → Uploads/links videos
4. **First Episode** → Marks episode 1 as free
5. **Publish** → Content appears on site
6. **Monitor** → Tracks views and engagement

### Discord Sync

```
User Subscribes → Stripe Webhook → Database Updated → Discord Bot Assigns Role
User Cancels → Stripe Webhook → Database Updated → Discord Bot Removes Role
```

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### Why Stripe over Discord Payments?
- Better control over pricing
- Works on website independently
- More flexible subscription management
- Easier to sync between platforms

### Why 3 Tiers?
- Free: Lets users try content (first episodes)
- Premium: Main revenue tier (all content)
- VIP: Premium service (DM access)

### Access Control Logic
- First episodes always free (marketing)
- Videos have tier requirements
- Channels have minimum tier requirements
- Users can only access if: `userTier >= requiredTier`

### Content Organization
- "Channels" = Series/Topics (e.g., "Basketball Fundamentals")
- "Videos" = Individual episodes within channels
- Organized by episode numbers and seasons

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

✅ Admin routes protected (role check)
✅ API routes validate user sessions
✅ Stripe webhooks verify signatures
✅ Discord tokens stored securely in .env
✅ Access control enforced server-side
✅ No client-side tier bypassing possible
